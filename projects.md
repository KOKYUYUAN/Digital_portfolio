## Smart Image Processing for Night Landscape Enhancement
Enhancing low-light night landscape images using digital image processing (DIP) techniques.

**Problem**
Night images suffer from low brightness, poor contrast, and noise.

**Solution**
A structured enhancement pipeline (contrast enhancement, noise reduction, sharpening).

**Tools**
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy

**Outcome**
- Visually clearer images with improved brightness and contrast.
