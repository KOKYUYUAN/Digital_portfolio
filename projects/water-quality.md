# Water Quality Monitoring
## Household IoT System for Real-time Water Analysis

## 💧 Overview
A smart IoT system designed to monitor household water quality in real-time. This system ensures that water parameters are within safe drinking limits and provides immediate feedback to the user.

## ⚙️ System Architecture
The system utilizes a network of sensors connected to a microcontroller, which transmits data to a cloud-based dashboard for visualization and logging.

## 📡 Sensors & Hardware
- **pH Sensor**: Measures the acidity or alkalinity of the water.
- **Turbidity Sensor**: Detects suspended particles (cloudiness).
- **Temperature Sensor**: Monitors water temperature variations.
- **ESP8266 / ESP32**: Wi-Fi enabled microcontroller for data transmission.

## 🖥️ Platform
- **Cloud Dashboard**: Data is visualized on a web or mobile dashboard (e.g., Blynk, ThingSpeak).
- **Alerts**: Notifies users if parameters exceed safe thresholds.

## ✅ Outcome
- Enables continuous assurance of water quality.
- Low-cost, scalable solution for home use.
